# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Objective
The objective of this challenge was to develop a layered map using GeoJSON data from publicly available United States Geological Society (USGS) earthquake data via their API to develop dynamic world maps that present information on earthquakes occurring in the past seven days, along with world tectonic plate boundaries, and a set of major (magnitude 4.5 or greater) earthquakes as well.

## Results
